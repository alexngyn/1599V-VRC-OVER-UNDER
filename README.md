# Team 1599V - Vietnamese Banana Farmers

We are a team from Saigon South International School.


# Comps:
Nov 11 Scrimage at SSIS

We did not do well because the low bot design restricts a good catapult and also we had to do a two motor catapult so did not have a effective pnumatic intake either. Cool RGB thou.
